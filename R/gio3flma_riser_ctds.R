#Desciption
#This script will request data from all of the riser CTD on the Global Irminger Flanking A Mooring between June 01, 2018 and June 02,2018.
#It does not consider efficiency when issuing data requests to OOINet.
#It will make a request and then check to see if the data has been made available before moving on to request the next dataset.
